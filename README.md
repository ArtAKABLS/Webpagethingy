1. Installed pipx as it is required to install poetry on windows
2. Ensured that pipx was path variable in windows
3. Installed Poetry via pipx in Powershell
4. Created a project in poetry (not sure if I was supposed to do that)
5. Used command "poetry env use 3.11.2" to create a new poetry virtual enviroment with version 3.11.2
6. Used command "poetry env info --path" to keep track of where the enviroment is located so I don't have to look for it later and saved it seperately
